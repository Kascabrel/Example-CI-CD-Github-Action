        Severe malaria remains the number one killer in our community. At Dza Kwelin Children's Hospital, we approach diagnosis and treatment with urgency and precision.
        <br><br>
        Our rapid diagnostic tests and microscopic blood smears confirm the parasite presence and density. Intravenous artesunate is our first-line treatment, delivered swiftly to stop the infection in its tracks.
        <br><br>
        Severe malaria often leads to life-threatening anemia, which is why we prioritize timely, safe blood transfusions. Our team ensures rigorous blood typing, cross-matching, and careful monitoring to improve patient outcomes and save lives.
